                <AccordionContent>
                  Our values are community-driven estimates updated regularly based on actual trading data, 
                  market trends, and community feedback. While we strive for accuracy, always verify trades 
                  independently as market conditions change frequently.

                <AccordionTrigger>How do I use the trade calculator?</AccordionTrigger>
                <AccordionContent>
                  Simply select the fruits you're offering and the fruits you want in return. The calculator 
                  will show you the total value difference and whether the trade is fair, in your favor, 
                  or against you. Green means good, red means unfavorable.

                <AccordionTrigger>What makes a trade "fair"?</AccordionTrigger>
                <AccordionContent>
                  A fair trade is when both sides have approximately equal total values (within 5% difference). 
                  However, rarity, demand, and personal preference also play important roles in trading decisions.

                <AccordionContent>
                  Fruit values fluctuate based on game updates, community demand, rarity changes, and trading patterns. 
                  New fruits, balance changes, and events can significantly impact the market.
